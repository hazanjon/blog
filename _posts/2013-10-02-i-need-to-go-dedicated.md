After attending Hackference in Birmingham I had to find hosting for our lastest hack, [SuperPirateBattleship](http://superpiratebattleship.com), a bit of research later and I grabbed a VPS from [Afterburst](http://afterburst.com). This worked brilliantly and I happily recommend them!

However, I soon realised I had many projects in different locations and that it was time for me to bite the bullet and get myself a dedicated server. 

My first idea was to get one of the [OVH Kimisufi](http://www.kimsufi.co.uk) range, these were cheap and offered very decent specs for a low price. The cheapest had already sold out and reading the OVH forums showed that there were long delivery times on the remaining Kimisufi box's. I slowly came to the conclusion I should actually spend the extra and go for a server capable of running a virtulisation enviroment as it would give me far more scope for learning and a better spec to cost ratio. This brought me into the [OVH mSP](http://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/mini-sp.xml) range, unfortunately these turned out to have two different prices depending on location (&pound;40 in France or &pound;60 US) and as is typical the cheapest had sold out.

A couple of weeks later I stumbled across Hetzner's server bidding, basically this is Hetzners way of recycling older hardware. A quick look through the listings yielded a perfect candidate:

- CPU: 3.4Ghz - i7-3770
- RAM: 16Gb DDR3
- HDD: 2 x 3Tb

Costing &euro;49 it was a little more than the OVH mSP but was about comparible spec wise, the bonus being there was no setup fee!

I ordered at around 8PM GMT and was asked to provide identification as it was my first purchase. I recieved the login deteails for the server at 9am the next morning which is a pretty impresive turnaround in my eyes for a brand new customer.
