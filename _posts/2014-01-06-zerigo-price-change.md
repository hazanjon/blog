So im pissed off... I just got home from spending Christmas with my family. During the break I had been checking emails by phone but not on a PC, by sheer chance after returning home I loaded up my computer and the last thing I had looked at was my junk email folder. I have a quick skim and as im about to empty it I see the word 'Zerigo' followed by 'Change of Plan Notice'.

I quickly open it up expecting a minor terms update etc etc as its usual for services to have to email for even the most minor changes to a service contract.

Instead I find that they have automatically moved me from a $19/yr account to a $38/mon account, ofcource the good news is they have 'discounted' it for me too..... $25/mon. I mean wth, thats a massive price increase and they didnt even try to ask for my consent to change or cancel, instead my pre-paid amount will be aplied pro-rata to the new cost, which by my guess is about the middle of this month.

As far as Im concerned when I paid I was buying a year of service, even if they are changing the price, I have already bought my year. They can charge me the new price when I come to renew. Instead I've got less than 14days if I'm lucky to find and migrate to a new DNS service.

This is akin to nominet deciding that they want to change more and increasing the price of domains from &pound;2.50 a year to &pound;50 a year. And then only notifying registrants by email before starting to take money from their banks.

I read through zerigos terms of service and it does indeed give them the right to cancel an account at any time for any reason, but nowhere do they give themselves the right to add a new service to an account and automatically charge for it!
