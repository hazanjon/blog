[Env[:hack]](http://envhack.com/) is the first hack day I have attended. Before now I didnt really know much about hack days or what they entailed. That all changed when my friend Mike emailed to say he had seen a hack day being run by [Ordanacy Survey](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/) and the [Enviroment Agency](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/) at the University of Bristol. As this is opposite where I current work I couldnt really say no!

The hack is part of a much larger drive by OS called [GeoVation](http://www.geovation.org.uk/) that is tasked with innovating ideas to improve the community through the use of geography.

##Challenge

The main category was a simple open ended challenge to use the data provided, there were 3 advertised prizes:

- Jury's Choice
- People's Choice
- Greenest Hack

There was also a mini challenge tied to Geovation using the theme:

&quot;How can we help British Business improve environmental performance?&quot;

##Data/API's

#Oranancy Survey
OS brought along many different map files

#Enviroment Agency
On top of the normal datasets available on their websites the EA also provided had a large selection of additional data availible to the attending teams.

##The Day

The day started badly with one member of our team being unable to attend, however while waiting for the day to start we met Ellie Ford a student of Bristol Uni who had been encouraged to come on her by a tutor. We quickly encouraged her to join our team and were back upto strength!
