#Event

the event was run at Boxxed in Birmingham. Boxxed proved to be a fantastic location to run a hack with loads of space for attendees to code and relax. It also proved useful for anyone using a Nodecopter as part of their hack.

Videos of the hacks can be seen here: #link#

#Idea

After running through a few ideas we finally settled on making a twillio controlled game that would use soundcloud to generate the level. The theme would be pirates! We would use a tetris style falling block play area with the user dodging the falling blocks.
